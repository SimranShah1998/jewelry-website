    <p>
      Inspired by symbols, secrets, and hidden meanings, this collection invites you to wear your story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewelry that speaks without saying a word. In a world where personalization has become predictable, the Cipher Collection offers something rare: jewelry that speaks in secret.
      Crafted using carefully placed round and baguette-cut diamonds to mimic the dots and dashes of Morse code, each piece encodes initials, dates, or words in a way that is deeply personal — and beautifully discreet.
      These are not basic monograms.
      They’re messages in stone.
